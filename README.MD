# The Natural Language Processing Repository.

This repository has the objective to hold all the material I collected about NLP subject.  
In its directories you will find some Jupyter Notebooks with my anotations about the courses and books about NLP I took and test scripts I built for exercising the knowledge, so the knowledge may be incomplete or not working the way it should.

However I hope this can help you to better understand this technology, enabling you to make wonderful things for all of us and feel free to contact me if you want to discuss about the subject or any of my scripts.

Regards
Alexandre
